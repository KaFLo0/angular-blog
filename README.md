# Blog

### My first project with Angular ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ
  This blog is about games in general, like new releases, gaming news, guides. On this project I focused on making the styles with BootStrap5 framework. <br>
  I've had a lot of fun (and much more challenges) while developing this blog, ngl the amount of problems I have encountered using BootStrap styling, for example, using tooltips and organizing components in blog pages, took me to spent hours trying to solving alignment and others interface problems. I feel like a learned a lot doing this project.

## To-do list
- Give more dynamics to all components
- Change the placeholders properties to something related to the blog theme
- Add more responsivity to mobile screens
- And more stuff

## Home-Page prints
